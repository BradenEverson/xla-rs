# xla-rs
Experimentation using the xla compiler from rust

Pre-compiled binaries for the xla library can be downloaded from the
[elixir-nx/xla repo](https://github.com/elixir-nx/xla/releases/tag/v0.3.0).
These should be extracted at the root of this repository, resulting
in a `xla_extension` subdirectory being created.
